        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vasily Kandinsky’s use of the horse-and-rider motif symbolized his crusade against conventional aesthetic values and his dream of a better, more spiritual future through the transformative powers of art. The rider is featured in many woodcuts, temperas, and oils, from its first appearance in the artist’s folk-inspired paintings, executed in his native Russia at the turn of the century, to his abstracted landscapes made in Munich during the early 1910s. The horseman was also incorporated into the cover designs for Kandinsky’s theoretical manifesto of 1911, On the Spiritual in Art, and the contemporaneous Blue Rider Almanac, which he coedited with Franz Marc.</p><p>In 1909, the year he completed Blue Mountain, Kandinsky painted no less than seven other canvases with images of riders. In that year his style became increasingly abstract and expressionistic and his thematic concerns shifted from the portrayal of natural events to apocalyptic narratives. By 1910 many of the artist’s abstract canvases shared a common literary source, the Revelation of Saint John the Divine; the rider came to signify the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who will bring epic destruction after which the world will be redeemed. In both Sketch for Composition II and Improvisation 28 (second version) Kandinsky depicted—through highly schematized means—cataclysmic events on one side of the canvas and the paradise of spiritual salvation on the other. In the latter painting, for instance, images of a boat and waves (signaling the global deluge), a serpent, and, perhaps, cannons emerge on the left, while an embracing couple, shining sun, and celebratory candles appear on the right.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Matisse painted Goldfish at home in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris.</p><p>This oil on canvas painting belongs to a series that Matisse produced between spring and early summer 1912.<br>Completed seven years after Matisse’s famous 1905 exhibition, this painting retains some of the vibrant colour and solid linear patterns associated with Fauves. However, it is a more subtle representation than other earlier works, combining colours and shapes in symphonic unity.</p><p>Beckoning the viewer towards the scene, the bright orange fish are central to the canvas against a colourful backdrop. The foliage as well as the ornamental railing or bench rail mimic the curves in the table on which the goldfish bowl perches. The entire composition feels balanced and the use of colours exudes a sense of soothing calm.</p><p>Goldfish became a recurring theme for Matisse. Appearing in nine of his paintings, as well as in his sketches and printworks. The goldfish immediately attract attention due to their colour. The vibrant orange strongly contrasts with the more subdued pinks and greens that surround the fish bowl and the sea green background. As complementary colours, when placed next to each other, blue and orange, as well as green and red, really set each other off.</p><p>Used extensively by the Fauves, this technique is particularly striking in Matisse’s earlier canvas Le Bonheur de Vivre. Although he later softened his palette, the bold orange is reminiscent of Matisse’s fauvist years, which continued to influence his use of colour until he died.</p><p>Matisse was perhaps interested in goldfish following a recent trip to Tangier, Morocco where he observed locals daydreaming whilst peering into goldfish bowls. He admired the Moroccans’ relaxed, contemplative lifestyle. For Matisse, the goldfish came to symbolise this serene state of mind. It also became a symbol of a paradise lost, a subject frequently represented in art.</p><p>This painting is an illustration of some of the major themes in Matisse’s painting: his use of complementary colours, his search for an idyllic paradise, his quest for contemplative relaxation for the observer and his complex construction of pictorial space.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The Scream</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/scream/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/scream/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Munch’s The Scream is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time. As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Munch defined how we see our own age - wracked with anxiety and uncertainty.</p><p>Essentially The Scream is autobiographical, an expressionistic construction based on Munch’s actual experience of a scream piercing through nature while on a walk, after his two companions, seen in the background, had left him. Fitting the fact that the sound must have been heard at a time when his mind was in an abnormal state, Munch renders it in a style which if pushed to extremes can destroy human integrity. As previously noted, the flowing curves of art nouveau represent a subjective linear fusion imposed upon nature, whereby the multiplicity of particulars is unified into a totality of organic suggestion with feminine overtones. But man is part of nature, and absorption into such a totality liquidates the individual. </p><p>Beginning at this time Munch included art nouveau elements in many pictures but usually only in a limited or modified way. Here, however, in depicting his own morbid experience, he has let go, and allowed the foreground figure to become distorted by the subjectivized flow of nature; the scream could be interpreted as expressing the agony of the obliteration of human personality by this unifying force. Significantly, although it was Munch himself who underwent the experience depicted, the protagonist bears no resemblance to him or anyone else. The creature in the foreground has been depersonalized and crushed into sexlessness or, if anything, stamped with a trace of the femininity of the world that has come close to assimilating it.</p><p>Several facts indicate Munch was aware of the danger of art of this sort for a neurotic humanist like himself. He soon abandoned the style and rarely if ever again subjected a foreground figure to this kind of radical and systematic distortion. At the top of another version of the subject (National Gallery, Oslo) he wrote: ‘Can only have been painted by a madman.’ He certainly had a horror of insanity, which had afflicted his sister Laura. Within the picture, he has set up a defense, in the form of the plunging perspective of the roadway and its fence, which preserves a rational world of three dimensions, holding at bay the swell of art nouveau curves. Safe in this rational world, the two men in the distance remain unequivocally masculine. In the foreground unified nature has come close to crossing the fence, close enough to distort the form and personality of the protagonist. But the fence still protects it from total absorption into subjective madness.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Mont Sainte-Victoire</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/mont/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/mont/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paul Cézanne painted Mount Sainte-Victoire many times. In this version, which is one of the largest he made of the subject, the landscape is beginning to disintegrate into the paint. The sky, for instance, is made up of simple overlapping tiles of colour that slightly vary in shade to give a rough, patchwork feel. The same patchwork is continued through the mountain, with fractional more contrast in tones and only a few crude brush marks delineating the outline of the ridge.  There is an intentional simplification of the landscape in the way Cézanne has built up this painting. The effect is much less about artifice and ornamentation — Cézanne was not trying to paint a lifelike illusion. Rather, he seemed to be looking for a type of harmonious form: he used structured blocks that fragment the surface, covering areas of canvas with parallel brushstrokes to create this shivering, faceted effect.</p><p>Cézanne was a painter who learned much from the Impressionists, many of whom he counted as friends. He adopted the same practice of painting outdoors, and like the Impressionists, tried to capture the effects of light through the layering of rough brushstrokes. His paintings developed out of meticulous observations of nature, as he expressed in his letters to his friend, the painter Emile Bernard: “I progress very slowly, for nature reveals herself to me in very complex ways; and the progress needed is endless. One must look at the model and feel very exactly; and also express oneself distinctly and with force.” (Letter to Emile Bernard, 12 May, 1904) Yet there is more to Cézanne than just a late-Impressionist. His work also explored the drama of the painted brush mark — and this would be a crucial step in the course of modern art.</p><p>Because of his influence on the generation of artists that followed him, especially Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, certain phrases have become connected with Cézanne: a bridge between Impressionism and Modernism; the forefather of Cubism; a painter of the natural world in terms of cylinders, spheres and cones. It is as if Cézanne attempted a new way of perceiving the world, and in the effort of turning his perception into paint, unlocked a new method of making art. To make such grand claims can predispose a viewer to expect extraordinary things of Cézanne’s art. One of the surprises, then, is how sober his work first appears. Landscapes and still-lives painted in restrained tones of cool-blue, light-greens and pale-oranges give the impression of a cerebral painter, one who hardly accords with the notion of a revolutionary. Paul Cézanne was born not far from Mount Sainte-Victoire, in Aix-en-Provence in 1839. The son of a bourgeois banker, he was encouraged by his father to study law, but Paul had other ideas. At the age of 22 he devoted himself entirely to painting. However much this may have displeased his father, Cézanne was not left out in the cold; he received a yearly allowance for the next 23 years until his father’s death, at which Cézanne inherited the family estate.</p><p>And so the scene is set, you might say, for a lifetime of painting pursued without economic distraction. The ability to work without concern for the marketplace may explain Cézanne’s relatively slow rise to eminence. That’s not to say that he was inactive. The decade of his 20s was a period of fervent research: having moved to Paris, he spent his spare time visiting art galleries with his schoolboy friend, the writer Émile Zola. He studied the likes of Gustave Courbet and Nicolas Poussin for guidance in his evolving technique.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Impression, Sunrise</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/impression/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/impression/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This famous painting, Impression, Sunrise, was created from a scene in the port of Le Havre. Monet depicts a mist, which provides a hazy background to the piece set in the French harbor. The orange and yellow hues contrast brilliantly with the dark vessels, where little, if any detail is immediately visible to the audience. It is a striking and candid work that shows the smaller boats in the foreground almost being propelled along by the movement of the water. This has, once again, been achieved by separate brushstrokes that also show various colors “sparkling” on the sea.</p><p>From the 15th April to 15th May 1874 Monet exhibited his work together with Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Édouard Manet, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, and some other thirty artists. They organized their exhibition on their own as they were usually rejected at the Paris Salon. Most visitors were disgusted and even outraged over such a graffiti. Monet’s Impression, Sunrise enjoyed the most attention and some visitors even claimed that they were absolutely unable to recognize what was shown at all. A critic who attended the exhibition, M. Louis Leroy, wrote a now-famous article in Le Charivari in which he used the term “Impressionist” based on the title of this painting. Despite the fact that Leroy had used the word derisively, the group decided to adopt it and painters such as Renoir and Degas were happy to be called Impressionists Despite its notoriety, the painting is in some ways untypical of Monet’s own work of this period and of Impressionism more generally. </p><p>It shows little of the Impressionist treatment of light and colour. The colours are very restrained and the paint is applied not in discrete brushstrokes of contrasting colours but in very thin washes. In some places, the canvas is even visible and the only use of impasto is in the depiction of the reflected sunlight on the water. The painting is strongly atmospheric rather than analytical and has a spirit somewhat akin to Turner’s works. Nevertheless, it does illustrate particularly well one of the features of an Impressionist painting that was thought so revolutionary. The technique is very ‘sketchy’ and would have been seen as a preliminary study for a painting rather than a finished work suitable for exhibition. (Monet himself saw the work as unfinished, and it was for that reason that he adopted the title ‘Impression’ to distinguish it from such works as his other view of Le Havre in the same exhibition, though this too lacks the finish than expected.) In this work, Monet stripped away the details to a bare minimum: the dockyards in tile background are merely suggested by a few brushstrokes as are the boats in the foreground. The whole represents the artist’s swift attempt to capture a fleeting moment. The highly visible, near-abstract technique, compels almost more attention than the subject-matter itself, a notion then wholly alien to viewers. </p><p>Today, Impression, Sunrise is considered as the most prominent Impressionism painting, along with the famous Van Gogh night stars painting.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Liberty Leading the People</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/liberty/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/liberty/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Liberty Leading the People, oil painting (1830) by French artist Eugène Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution in Paris that removed Charles X, the restored Bourbon king, from the throne. The heroic scene of rebellion was initially received with mixed reviews, but it became one of Delacroix’s most popular paintings, an emblem of the July Revolution and of justified revolt. </p><p>The July Revolution of 1830</p><p>Delacroix started painting after witnessing the violent escalation of protests against a set of restrictive ordinances that Charles X issued on July 26, 1830. For three days, later known as les Trois Glorieuses (July 27–29), working- and middle-class citizens set up barricades in the Paris streets and fought the royal army. Unable to contain the insurrection, Charles X soon abdicated. Louis-Philippe, the so-called Citizen King, took the throne and created a constitutional monarchy. Historians speculate that Delacroix’s dependence on royal commissions prevented him from taking part in the rebellion outright, but he was nonetheless moved when he saw insurgents raise the Tricolor, the French national flag, on Notre Dame, a turning point in the rebellion.</p><p>Description and symbolism</p><p>Delacroix finished the painting in three months, and it was shown with 23 other revolution-inspired works at the 1831 Salon, an annual exhibition of French art held at the Louvre. Yet Delacroix, by combining realism and idealism and by applying his characteristically expressive brushwork, created a more modern scene that contrasted with those of his competitors. Contemporary critics and viewers were nonetheless divided on whether the painting was heroic or distasteful. A half-nude female figure dominates the monumental painting (8.5 × 10.66 feet [2.6 × 3.25 metres]) as she charges forward, a crowd of determined revolutionists in her wake. She is a personification of liberty, a classical symbol used throughout the history of art. Indeed, her yellow dress swirls around her body, loosely tied with red rope and falling from her shoulders in a manner that is reminiscent of heroic Greek sculptures, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace (c. 190 BCE). Yet she is also of the moment, wearing a red Phrygian cap that resembles the stocking cap worn by the working class and made popular during the French Revolution (1787–99) as a “liberty cap” but which originates from antiquity. Her modernity is heightened by the Tricolor she hoists above her head and the musket with the bayonet she grasps in her other hand. Some critics, however, found her grimy skin and alleged underarm hair to be too human for a personified ideal.  </p><p>The fighters are also idealized realist figures, representing the different types of people who took part in the revolution. To the left is a member of the bourgeoisie, identified by his top hat, cravat, and tailored black coat. He is armed with a hunting shotgun. Farther back is a craftsman or factory worker, wearing a work shirt, apron, and sailor pants and wielding a sabre. A younger figure to the right, marked as a student by his faluche, a black velvet beret, shouts a rallying call as he brandishes a pistol in each hand. Liberty surmounts a barricade of cobblestones and fallen figures, as one wearied fighter looks up hopefully at her. Another figure, a male in a nightshirt and nude from the waist down, lies at the bottom left corner. He may have been beaten by the opposition in his home and dragged into the street as an example. A member of the royal army, recognizable by his blue coat and epaulets, lies next to a fallen comrade in the other corner.</p><p>In the background Notre Dame rises through a clearing of smoke, its south tower nearly obscuring its twin and heralding a barely discernible Tricolor on its roof. The cathedral is the only structure Delacroix included in an arrangement of churning human bodies, but he subdued the chaos of the scene by using a pyramidal composition and fairly muted colours.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A man, blind-folded, head downcast, stands bound to a wooden pole. His white clothes, despite tears and rips, seem to emit light; although the man’s off-kilter posture signifies defeat, he is yet heroic, an Alter Christus—another Christ. On the ground in front of him is a corpse, contorted, the spine twisted, arms and legs sprawled in opposite directions. His grotesque face looks out at us through obscured eyes as blood and brain matter ooze out of his skull and pool around his head. Seconds ago this man was alive. Further off, to our hero’s left, other men, doubled-over and on their knees, are similarly secured to wooden stakes. To his right we see the cause of the carnage: a neat line of soldiers aim rifles at the men, the muzzle of their weapons disappearing behind our hero’s hip. But the rest of the gun is not left to our imagination. Suddenly—and in such an obvious position that we wonder how we did not see them before—the barrel of three rifles appear from the right edge of the picture, aimed at our messianic hero. Not only is he about to die, but his executioners are everywhere. As the caption of the picture tells us, “Y no hay remedio” (And there’s nothing to be done).  Francisco Goya created the aquatint series The Disasters of War from 1810 to 1820. The eighty-two images add up to a visual indictment of and protest against the French occupation of Spain by Napoleon Bonaparte. The French Emperor had seized control of the country in 1807 after he tricked the king of Spain, Charles IV, into allowing Napoleon’s troops to pass its border, under the pretext of helping Charles invade Portugal. He did not. Instead, he usurped the throne and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as ruler of Spain. Soon, a bloody uprising, occurred, in which countless Spaniards were slaughtered in Spain’s cities and countryside. Although Spain eventually expelled the French in 1814 following the Peninsular War (1807-1814), the military conflict was a long and gruesome ordeal for both nations. Throughout the entire time, Goya worked as a court artist for Joseph Bonaparte, though he would later deny any involvement with the French “intruder king.”</p><p>Process</p><p>Goya created his Disasters of War series by using the techniques of etching and drypoint. Goya was able to use this technique to create nuanced shades of light and dark that capture the powerful emotional intensity of the horrific scenes in the Disasters of War.</p><p>The first step was to etch the plate. This was done by covering a copper plate with wax and then scratching lines into the wax with a stylus (a sharp needle-like implement) thus exposed the metal. The plate was then placed in an acid bath. The acid bit into the metal where it was exposed (the rest of the plate was protected by the wax). Next the acid was washed from the plate and the plate was heated so the wax softened and could be wiped away. The plate then had soft, even, recessed lines etched by the acid where Goya had drawn into the wax.</p><p>The next step, drypoint, created lines by a different method. Here Goya scratched directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus. This resulted in a less even line since each scratch left a small ragged ridge on either side of the line. These minute ridges catch the ink and create a soft distinctive line when printed. However, because these ridges are delicate and are crushed by repeatedly being run through a press, the earliest prints in a series are generally more highly valued. Finally, the artist inked the plate and wiped away any excess so that ink remained only in the areas where the acid bit into the metal plate or where the stylus had scratched the surface. The plate and moist paper were then placed atop one another and run through a press. The paper, now a print, drew the ink from the metal, and became a mirror of the plate.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Woman Holding a Balance</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/balance/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/balance/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Woman Holding a Balance is a superb example of Johannes Vermeer’s exquisite sense of stability and rhythm. A woman dressed in a blue jacket with fur trim stands serenely at a table in a corner of a room. The scales in her right hand are at equilibrium, suggestive of her inner state of mind. A large painting of the Last Judgment, framed in black, hangs on the back wall of the room. A shimmering blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls, and a gold chain lie on the sturdy table. Soft light comes in through the window and illuminates the scene. The woman is so pensive that the viewer almost hesitates to intrude on her quiet moment of contemplation.</p><p>The visual juxtaposition of the woman and the Last Judgment is reinforced by thematic parallels: to judge is to weigh. This scene has religious implications that seem related to Saint Ignatius of Loyola’s instructions, in his Spiritual Exercises, that the faithful, prior to meditating, first examine their conscience and weigh their sins as if facing Judgment Day. Only such introspection could lead to virtuous choices along the path of life. Woman Holding a Balance thus allegorically urges us to conduct our lives with temperance and moderation. The woman is poised between the earthly treasures of gold and pearls and a visual reminder of the eternal consequences of her actions.</p><p>Vermeer emphasized this message through his superbly refined composition and lighting. The hand holding the balance, for example, occupies a position directly in front of the frame’s dark corner, while the scales are set off against the bare plaster wall—an effect that Vermeer created through subtle spatial manipulation. Note, for instance, that the bottom of the Last Judgment’s frame is slightly higher to the left of the woman than it is behind her back, creating room for the balance.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Calling of Saint Matthew</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/matthew/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/matthew/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Caravaggio, one of the best artists of all time, is best known for his highly realistic style of Baroque painting which - together with the classicism of Annibale Carracci (1560-1609) - effectively buried the artificial idiom of Mannerism and revitalized large scale religious art in Rome and Naples. Although cursed with a violent nature, Caravaggio was one of the most influential Italian artists of the 17th century. Orphaned by the plague in 1584, he learned painting in Milan from Simone Peterzano, and around 1592 moved to Rome where - thanks to genre paintings like The Cardsharps (1594, Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth) - he rapidly acquired several patrons, one of whom - Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte - helped him to gain his first major public commission for the side walls of the Contarelli Chapel, in San Luigi dei Francesi. It involved two pictures: The Calling of St Matthew (1599-1600) and The Martyrdom of St Matthew (1599-1600). Both works were an immediate success, and were followed by a series of masterpieces that made him the most exciting painter of religious paintings in Rome. What made Caravaggio so unique, was the true-life naturalism that made his figures seem completely real. Unfortunately, some conservative ecclesiastics considered his style of painting to be too vulgar, although it was much sought after by art collectors and other painters. After his death, his signature style of painting - based on his use of tenebrism and chiaroscuro - would become known as Caravaggism and influence painters throughout Europe.</p><p>The Calling of Saint Matthew depicts the moment when Jesus Christ inspires Matthew to follow him and become an apostle. The picture was commissioned by the will of Cardinal Matthew Contarelli, who had provided resources and specific guidelines for the decoration of a chapel based on scenes from the life of his namesake, Saint Matthew. The ceiling of the chapel had already been decorated with frescoes by the popular Mannerist painter Cavaliere d’Arpino (Giuseppe Cesari) (1568-1640), but because he was too busy with papal work to decorate the walls, Del Monte intervened to secure the job for Caravaggio.</p><p>The Calling of Saint Matthew illustrates the passage in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 9:9), when Jesus went into the custom house, saw Matthew at his seat and called to him, “Follow me”. According to the story Matthew rose and followed him. In the painting, Christ (on the right, behind Peter) points to Levi, the tax-collector (the bearded man wearing a beret, who also appears in the two other Matthew paintings in the chapel) - and calls upon him to become the apostle Matthew. Although Levi is well to the left of the picture, the viewer’s attention is nevertheless drawn to him by the hands pointing at him as well as by the intensity of the light shining on him. In keeping with his plain, unvarnished aesthetics, Caravaggio borrows from his earlier genre painting (The Cardsharps, The Fortune-Teller), and sets the scene in what appears to be a tavern, rather than a counting house or office. He may have modelled it on earlier examples of Northern Renaissance art - by Hans Holbein and others - featuring money lenders seated around a table. In addition, he introduces some very human interplay into the situation. To begin with, when he sees Christ pointing at him, Levi responds with a gesture, as if to say “Me?” indicating his uncertainty whether he is being addressed, or the younger man slumped on his right. In addition, the ray of light illuminating their faces, draws attention to the two youths, who appear rather lost in this group of older men. While one of them draws back in apprehension and looks to his older neighbour for protection, the other has turned to confront Christ, causing Saint Peter to gesture firmly for calm. Through the visual contrast between their reactions, Caravaggio displays psychological insight into two possible patterns of human behaviour in the same situation.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The Oxbow</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/21/oxbow/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/21/oxbow/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Usually referred to as The Oxbow, this painting shows two very different aspects of the American landscape. To the left of the canvas, dense grey clouds hang over a forest of green trees; to the right, the Connecticut River meanders gently through cultivated fields under a blue sky.</p><p>A key painting in Cole’s oeuvre, and arguably his best-known work, The Oxbow was created at a time when Cole was largely occupied with his Course of Empire series; his patron Luman Reed had advised him to take a break from that series, as Cole seemed to be showing signs of depression, and to return to the genre of Romantic landscape painting which he loved most of all. Whereas The Course of Empire stands as a stark warning on the fate of civilization, this painting presents a more complex, though still polemical, statement on the potential direction of American society. The uncultivated landscape to the left is at once threatening and enticing, while the cultivated land to the right presents an equivocal image of security, complicated by the presence of scar-lines in the forest on the far hills: signs of the aggressive over-husbandry of the land. Debate exists as to whether a written message can be made out in these marks, with some scholars believing that the lines were intended to spell out the word “Noah” in Hebrew, and would, from the aerial perspective of God, read “Shaddai” or “The Almighty”. If that reading is accepted, then the landscape - which, after all, shows a floodplain - stands for the hubris of human society awaiting the cleansing force of divine judgement.</p><p>Cole personalized the work by depicting himself at the center of the canvas. Gazing back at the viewer from between two crags, the minute figure of the artist preserves the landscape on his canvas before it is lost, and, perhaps, invites our own judgement on the scene. This personal element reflects Cole’s feeling of emotional connection to the work, which now stands as one of the most quintessential examples of mid-19th-century North American landscape painting.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of Turner’s most celebrated works, “Slave Ship” is a striking example of the artist’s fascination with violence, both human and elemental. He based the painting on an 18th-century poem that described a slave ship caught in a typhoon and on the true story of the Zong, a British ship whose captain, in 1781, had thrown overboard sick and dying enslaved people so that he could collect insurance money only available for those “lost at sea.” Turner captures the horror of the event and the terrifying grandeur of nature through hot, churning color and light that merge sea and sky. The critic John Ruskin, the first owner of “Slave Ship,” wrote, “If I were reduced to rest Turner’s immortality upon any single work, I should choose this.”</p><p>When Turner exhibited this picture at the Royal Academy in 1840, he paired it with the following extract from his unfinished and unpublished poem “Fallacies of Hope” (1812):</p><p>“Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay;<br>Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds<br>Declare the Typhon’s coming.<br>Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard<br>The dead and dying - ne’er heed their chains<br>Hope, Hope, fallacious Hope!<br>Where is thy market now?”</p>]]></content>

      <title>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</title>

      <url>/2021/06/21/wave/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Had Katsushika Hokusai died when he was struck by lightning at the age of 50 in 1810, he would be remembered as a popular artist of the ukiyo-e, or “floating world” school of Japanese art, but hardly the great figure we know today. His late blooming (the subject of an exhibition, Hokusai: Beyond the Great Wave, opening at the British Museum next week) was spectacular – it was only in his 70s that he made his most celebrated print series, Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, including the famous Great Wave, an image that subsequently swept over the world. “Until the age of 70,” he once wrote (self-consciously parodying Confucius) “nothing that I drew was worthy of notice.”</p><p>Kitagawa Utamaro</p><p>It was a good boast but not quite true – he had begun his manga, woodblock print books of sketches that were wildly popular, in his 50s. They stretched to 15 volumes (the last three published posthumously), and covered every subject imaginable: real and imaginary figures and animals, plants and natural scenes, landscapes and seascapes, dragons, poets and deities combined together in a way that defies all attempts to weave a story around them. Leafing through the manga in the original or a facsimile is a mind-expanding experience, one that should be prescribed for all aspiring artists. In their observation and invention they have been compared to Rembrandt and Van Gogh, and rightly so for the thrilling panorama they provide both of the world and of Hokusai’s imagination.</p><p>If the manga made Hokusai’s name, the Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (there are in fact 46 prints in the series) ensured his fame. Hokusai’s obsession with Mount Fuji was part of his hankering after artistic immortality – in Buddhist and Daoist tradition, Fuji was thought to hold the secret of immortality, as one popular interpretation of its names suggests: “Fu-shi” (“not death”). I saw the mountain for the first time last year, from the window of the Shinkansen bullet train. You quickly understand how it dominates the landscape, as the train curves around, revealing it over woodlands and cities, behind buildings, over the plains – and why Hokusai returned to it so often, like a pivot for his restless imagination.  </p><p>THE WORK</p><p>Notice the brush strokes. For the sky they swirl, each dab of color rolling with the clouds around the stars and moon. On the cypress tree they bend with the curve of the branches. The whole effect is ethereal and dreamlike. The hills easily roll down into the little village below. In contrast, the town is straight up and down, done with rigid lines that interrupt the flow of the brush strokes. Tiny little trees soften the inflexibility of the town. Bringing nature into the unnaturalness of buildings.</p><p>One of the biggest points of interest about this painting is that it came entirely from Van Gogh’s imagination. None of the scenery matches the area surrounding Saint-Paul or the view from his window. As a man who religiously paints what he sees, it’s a remarkable break from Van Gogh’s normal work.<br>The contrast in styles plays on the natural versus the unnatural, dreams versus reality. Nature could even be attributed to the divine in this work. In Genesis 37:9, Joseph states, “And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.” - predicting that one day his family would bow to him as an authority. Some people associate this quote to the painting. Perhaps it is a reference to Van Gogh’s family, who doubted the success of his career (with the notable exception of his brother). It could be that Van Gogh simply wanted to breathe in the higher power into his art, as he grew up in a religious household. Divide the painting into three parts. The sky is the divine. It is by far the most dreamlike, unreal part of the painting, beyond human comprehension and just out of reach. Go down one level to the cypress, the hills, and the other trees on the ground. They bend and swirl, still soft angles that match the soft swirls of the sky. The last part is the village. The straight lines and sharp angles divide it from the rest of the painting, seemingly separating it from the “heavens” of the sky. However, note the dots of trees rolled through the village, how the spire of the church stretches up to the sky. Van Gogh brings God to the village.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The School of Athens represents all the greatest mathematicians, philosophers and scientists from classical antiquity gathered together sharing their ideas and learning from each other. These figures all lived at different times, but here they are gathered together under one roof.</p><p>The two thinkers in the very center, Aristotle (on the right) and Plato (on the left, pointing up) have been enormously important to Western thinking generally, and in different ways, their different philosophies were incoporated into Christianity.</p><p>Plato points up because in his philosophy the changing world that we see around us is just a shadow of a higher, truer reality that is eternal and unchanging (and include things like goodness and beauty). For Plato, this otherworldly reality is the ultimate reality, and the seat of all truth, beauty, justice, and wisdom. Plato holds his book called the Timaeus.</p><p>Aristotle holds his hand down, because in his philosophy, the only reality is the one that we can see and experience by sight and touch (exactly the reality dismissed by Plato). Aristotle’s Ethics (the book that he holds) “emphasized the relationships, justice, friendship, and government of the human world and the need to study it.”</p><p>Pythagoras (lower left) believed that the world (including the movement of the planets and stars) operated according to mathematical laws. These mathematical laws were related to ideas of musical and cosmic harmony, and thus (for the Christians who interpreted him in the Renaissance) to God. Pythagoras taught that each of the planets produced a note as it moved, based on its distance from the earth. Together, the movement of all the planets was perfect harmony – “the harmony of the spheres.”</p><p>Ptolemy (he has his back to us on the lower right), holds a sphere of the earth, next to him is Zaroaster who holds a celestial sphere. Ptolemy tried to mathematically explain the movements of the planets (which was not easy since some of them appear to move backwards!). His theory of how they all moved around the earth remained the authority until Copernicus and Kepler figured out (in the late 16th century) that the earth was not at the center of the universe, and that the planets moved in orbits the shape of ellipses not in circles. Raphael included a self-portrait of himself, standing next to Ptolemy. He looks right out at us.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bit of history about the Leonardo’s Last Supper</p><p>The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci (Cenacolo Vinciano) is one of the most famous paintings in the world. This artwork was painted between 1494 and 1498 under the government of Ludovico il Moro and represents the last “dinner” between Jesus and his disciples.</p><p>In order to create this unique work, Leonardo carried out an exhaustive research creating an infinity of preparatory sketches. Leonardo abandons the traditional method of fresco painting, painting the scene “dry” on the wall of the refectory. Traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist’s willingness to make the figures in a much more realistic manner, including precious details. After completion, his technique and environmental factor had contributed to the eventual deterioration of the fresco, which had undergone numerous restorations.</p><p>The most recent restoration was completed in 1999 where several scientific methods were used to restore the original colors as close as possible, and to eliminate traces of paint applied in previous attempts to restore the fresco.</p><p>What is the Leonardo’s Last Supper nowadays?</p><p>Leonardo’s Last Supper is located in its original place, on the wall of the dining room of the former Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, exactly in the refectory of the convent and is one of the most celebrated and well known artworks in the world.</p><p>Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Last Supper”, a huge painting of 4.60 meters high and 8.80 meters wide was made with tempera and oil on a gypsum preparation instead of the technique commonly used in the fresco period.</p><p>Several measures have now been implemented to protect the paint from deterioration. To ensure that the fresco is maintained at room temperature, since the last restoration, visitor’s’ entry has been restricted to a group of 25 people every 15 minutes.</p><p>Curiosities about the Leonardo’s Last Supper</p><p>Did you know that the great fame of this masterpiece has awaken the interest of many historians, researchers and novelists who seek to solve the supposed mysteries and enigmas that surround this painting. For example, in the books “The Templar Revelation” by Clive Prince and Lynn Picknett and in the novel Dan Brown’s Da Vinci Code, it is affirmed that the figure to the right of Jesus is not the apostle John, but a female figure. The truth is that these mysteries and curiosities have not yet been solved.</p><p>Did you know that during the French Revolutionary War Napoleon’s troops used the wall of the refectory to make target practice and during the Second World War in 1943 the bombings managed to tear off the roof of the old Dominican dining room leaving the paint in the open for several years.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Birth of Venus</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/20/venus/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/20/venus/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Botticelli’s Birth of Venus</p><p>Sandro Botticelli, Birth of Venus, c. 1484-86, tempera on canvas</p><p>Aside from his painting of the Primavera, Sandro Botticelli’s other greatest work, done for the Medici family, is the Birth of Venus. Unfortunately, we do not know for sure which Medici it was painted for, or which location it was originally hung in.</p><p>Before considering the subject matter, it is important to take note of the medium. This is a work of tempera on canvas. During this time, wood panels were popular surfaces for painting, and they would remain popular through the end of the sixteenth century. Canvas, however, was starting to gain acceptance by painters. It worked well in humid regions, such as Venice, because wooden panels tended to warp in such climates. Canvas also cost less than wood, but it was also considered to be less formal, which made it more appropriate for paintings that would be shown in non-official locations (e.g. countryside villas, rather than urban palaces). The theme of the Birth of Venus was taken from the writings of the ancient poet, Homer. According to the traditional account, after Venus was born, she rode on a seashell and sea foam to the island of Cythera. In the painting we see here, Venus is prominently depicted in the center, born out of the foam as she rides to shore. On the left, the figure of Zephyrus carries the nymph Chloris (alternatively identified as “Aura”) as he blows the wind to guide Venus.<br>On shore, a figure who has been identified as Pomona, or as the goddess of Spring, waits for Venus with mantle in hand. The mantle billows in the wind from Zephyrus’ mouth.</p><p>The composition is similar in some respects to that of the Primavera. Venus is slightly to the right of center, and she is isolated against the background so no other figures overlap her. She has a slight tilt of the head, and she leans in an awkward contrapposto-like stance. Botticelli paid much attention to her hair and hairstyle, which reflected his interest in the way women wore their long hair in the late fifteenth century. He gave Venus an idealized face which is remarkably free of blemishes, and beautifully shaded her face to distinguish a lighter side and a more shaded side.</p><p>Of obvious importance in this painting is the nudity of Venus. The depiction of nude women was not something that was normally done in the Middle Ages, with a few exceptions in specific circumstances. For the modeling of this figure, Botticelli turned to an Aphrodite statue, such as the Aphrodite of Cnidos, in which the goddess attempts to cover herself in a gesture of modestly.</p><p>In painting Venus, Botticelli painted a dark line around the contours of her body. This made it easier to see her bodily forms against the background, and it also emphasized the color of her milky skin. The result of all of this is that Venus almost looks like her flesh is made out of marble, underscoring the sculpturesque nature of her body. The demand for this type of scene, of course, was humanism, which was alive and well in the court of Lorenzo d’Medici in the 1480s. Here, Renaissance humanism was open not only to the use of a pagan sculpture as a model, but also a pagan narrative for the subject matter.<br>Although the Birth of Venus is not a work which employed Renaissance perspectival innovations, the elegance of the classical subject matter was something that would have intrigued wealthy Florentines who patronized this type of work. However, it would not have appealed to everyone, like those who viewed the worldly behavior of the ruling Medici family as corrupt or vile. By the 1490s, the tension that resulted from the clash between courtly excess and those who wanted religious reform came to a climax when the preacher Savonarola preached his crusade to the people of Florence. One of the people influenced by the preacher was Botticelli, whose change of heart moved him to destroy some of his early painting by fire.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Return of the Hunters</title>
      <link href="/2021/06/20/Hunter/"/>
      <url>/2021/06/20/Hunter/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Interpretation of Hunters in the Snow</p><p>One of the most famous landscape paintings of the Northern Renaissance, Hunters in the Snow was originally part of a series of twelve landscapes (“Twelve Months”) covering all the months of the year. Commissioned by the wealthy Antwerp banker Niclaes Jonghelinck, the work was almost certainly called January. Other surviving pictures in the series include The Gloomy Day (February) (1565, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), Haymaking (July) (1565, National Gallery, Prague), The Harvesters (August) (1565, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and The Return of the Herd (probably November) (1565, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Another celebrated snow scene by Bruegel, which is not part of the “Twelve Months” series, is Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap (1565, private collection). These panel paintings did much to secure Bruegel’s reputation as one of the best landscape artists of Northern Europe. His unique contribution to the genre was to invest it with significant narrative on the rural mores and behaviour of 16th century Netherlanders. See also: Protestant Reformation Art (c.1520-1700).</p><p>Colour Scheme</p><p>Also called The Return of the Hunters, this Bruegel oil painting - which is, incidentally the world’s most popular classical Christmas card design - evokes the harsh conditions and temperatures of winter. In the foreground, three hunters are depicted returning from a hunting expedition with only a fox, to show for their effort. They and their dogs appear exhausted as they pass a small group of peasants “singeing” a pig to remove its bristles. The valley occupies the middle ground of the picture, frozen ponds and fields are dotted with skaters, while icicles hand from the mill wheel to the right. Bare trees litter the landscape. Fringed with mountain foothills and a cluster of jagged peaks (based on sketches made during the artist’s 1552-3 trip through the Alps), the valley stretches as far as the horizon, populated by small villages laid out in the frozen flatlands. The entire scene is characterized by Bruegel’s chilly colour scheme of pale green sky and ice, along with muted white snow - both set off by the dark browns and blacks of the trees, birds, dogs and people. (See also Renaissance Colour Palette.) It is a cold, gloomy late afternoon in winter - the season of barren earth, sleep and death.</p><p>Composition</p><p>The composition is ideal as the first in a frieze of pictures covering the full year. Trees on the left make an ideal framing device, while the hunters intended path down the hill into the valley to the right leads the viewer easily into the rest of the “Months”. In addition, the line of trees and the line of houses - both of which begin in the left-hand foreground and then follow the left-to-right downward slope of the hill - automatically give the picture instant depth. A further line of trees enhance the linear perspective by leading the viewer’s eye into the centre of the valley. In fact, the whole picture is effectively structured around two main diagonals formed by (1) the left-to-right line of hunters, trees and left-hand edge of the frozen ponds/fields; and (2) the right to left line formed by the trees running along the base of the hills and peaks.</p><p>Details</p><p>As usual for a Bruegel, the painting is filled with detail. See, for instance, the tree branches ‘dusted’ with fine snow; the Inn sign inscribed with the words “Under the Stag” and an image of Saint Eustace; figures tobogganing, curling and spinning tops in the ponds; the firemen extinguishing a chimney fire; people shooting birds; the watermill with its frozen water wheel; and the village church steeples providing visual reference points in the far distance.</p><p>Meaning</p><p>Most of Bruegel’s landscape and genre painting follows in the broad tradition of Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516). Thus his art is rarely if ever devoid of religious significance. The meaning of Hunters in the Snow is simply that the man himself is a powerless entity, of no consequence, who is at the mercy of the natural seasons and rhythms of the year. The implication is, that only faith in the Creator and the natural (divine) order can bring us meaning and comfort. This is a low-key example of religious art, which - like a good deal of Netherlandish art of the 16th and 17th century - provides a very ordinary (even secular) setting, for its message.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? is a Post-Impressionist oil on canvas painting created by Paul Gauguin from 1897 to 1898. It lives at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in the United States. The image is in the public domain, and tagged allegory. </p><p>In the winter of 1897, Paul Gauguin set down his brush, walked up a hill near his home in Tahiti and swallowed a huge amount of arsenic. The painting he completed before this suicide expressed his personal gospel, a dream-state allegory spanning the largest canvas of his career.</p><p>The years leading up to the December of 1897 had been rough for Gauguin. During his time on the Caribbean island of Martinique he’d contracted long-running cases of dysentery and malaria, he walked with a limp from a poorly healed ankle, broken in a fight five years earler, and was exhausted from battling syphilis and its brutal treatment regime. His reputation in Paris was blighted after leaving his wife, his paintings weren’t selling, and in 1897 his estranged daughter Aline died of pneumonia, leaving Gauguin fixated on their lost relationship. Finally, running out of money in Tahiti after a failed building project, Gauguin constructed a massive canvas, and poured his last great energy into an allegorical diorama describing destiny, the futility of language and death.</p><p>Gauguin awoke, vomiting. The arsenic had failed to kill him, and he would live another six years. In later letters, Gauguin would describe Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? saying: “It is a canvas about five feet by twelve. The two upper corners are chrome yellow, with an inscription on the left, and my name on the right, like a fresco on a golden wall with its corners damaged.</p><p>“To the right, below, a sleeping baby and three seated women.
